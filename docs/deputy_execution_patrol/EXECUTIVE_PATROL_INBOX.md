# EXECUTIVE_PATROL_INBOX.md

This file is the dedicated inbox for Executive Officer patrol findings that require Deputy Codex.

Deputy Codex owns final decisions. The Executive Officer may append decision-worthy findings here, but must not use this file to bypass the blackboard or Commander.

Status:
RESOLVED_BY_DEPUTY

Executive Officer:
EXECUTIVE_OFFICER

Workstream:
Plan Puzzle / plancraft/page-ui / plancraft/adapter-clean

Issue / PR:
laibeoffer/laibe-mvp Issue #15

Finding:
Second Executive Officer patrol still found no PR URL, issue claim, validation result, or exact blocker.

Evidence:
Latest main b2eace511f4a21b79572e747da6f742934d1bc08; branch plancraft/zone-area-boundary-refinement not found; Issue #15 comments now include Executive Officer follow-up.

Action already taken:
Posted EXECUTIVE_CALL_OUT comment to Issue #15 and published blackboard short-format entry.

Recommended Deputy action:
Monitor next patrol result and decide whether additional routing or workstream correction is needed if #15 remains empty.

Need Commander:
No

Need Reviewer:
No

Deputy Decision:
Accepted. Executive Officer correctly escalated the second-patrol no-response for Issue #15. No Commander or Reviewer escalation is needed yet. Executive Officer should continue first-line chase and require a PR URL, issue claim, validation result, or exact blocker. If the next Executive Officer patrol still finds no useful response, publish another `EXECUTIVE_CALL_OUT` and keep the item visible for Deputy follow-up.

Executive Officer:
EXECUTIVE_OFFICER

Workstream:
Raw Candidate / warehouse/raw-candidate

Issue / PR:
laibeoffer/laibe-mvp Issue #17

Finding:

Evidence:
Latest main b2eace511f4a21b79572e747da6f742934d1bc08; branch warehouse/raw-source-quality-scoring not found; Issue #17 comments now include Executive Officer follow-up.

No unless formal pricing boundary appears.

Deputy Decision:
Accepted. Executive Officer correctly escalated the second-patrol no-response for Issue #17. No Commander or Reviewer escalation is needed yet. Executive Officer should continue first-line chase and require a PR URL, issue claim, candidate-only validation result, forbidden-pricing-field check, or exact blocker. If the next Executive Officer patrol still finds no useful response, publish another `EXECUTIVE_CALL_OUT` and keep the item visible for Deputy follow-up.

### 2026-05-24T19:56:49Z - [EXECUTIVE_CALL_OUT] - Quote Factory

Status:
RESOLVED_BY_DEPUTY

Executive Officer:
EXECUTIVE_OFFICER

Workstream:
Quote Factory / quote-factory/price-range-governance

Issue / PR:
laibeoffer/laibe-quote-factory Issue #1

Finding:
Second Executive Officer patrol found unreported progress but still no PR URL, validation result, formal pricing check, Supabase/API/migration check, or blackboard handoff report.

Evidence:
Branch qf/qf5-3-audit-override-publish exists, is ahead of main by 1 commit, and changes QF5.3/QF roadmap files; no PR URL was found in patrol sources.

Action already taken:
Posted EXECUTIVE_CALL_OUT comment to Quote Factory Issue #1 and published blackboard short-format entry.

Recommended Deputy action:
Monitor next patrol result and decide whether additional routing or workstream correction is needed if Quote Factory does not provide PR URL or validation blocker.

Need Commander:
No

Need Reviewer:
No unless formal pricing / API / migration boundary appears.

Deputy Decision:
Accepted. Executive Officer correctly identified unreported Quote Factory progress: branch `qf/qf5-3-audit-override-publish` exists but no PR URL / validation report was found. No Commander or Reviewer escalation is needed yet. Executive Officer should require a PR URL, validation result, formal pricing negative check, Supabase / API / migration negative check, or exact blocker. If the next Executive Officer patrol still finds no PR or blocker, keep the item visible for Deputy follow-up; Deputy may then verify branch scope and repair the PR workflow if needed.
